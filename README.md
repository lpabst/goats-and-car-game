# Car and goats game
Visual reproduction of the car and goats game. The player is presented with
three doors and is allowed to choose one, but doesn't open it yet. Two of the
doors have a goat behind them, and one has a new car. The player gets to keep
whatever is behind the door they decide to open.

Once the player has selected a door, the game show host opens one of the other 
two doors, revealing a goat (the door opened by the host always has a goat behind 
it). The player is then allowed to either open the original door they picked,
or switch and open the other door.

###Statistics
Most people are averse to change, and stick with their original choice, but 
statistically you are more likely to win the car if you switch to the other
unopened door. This app allows you to play the game over and over again, and
it will keep track of your winnings in order to demonstrate the statistics 
behind the game!
